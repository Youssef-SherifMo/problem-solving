        * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
        * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
        * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot,
        * i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
        *
        * ex:
        * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
        * Output: 5
        * Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
        * This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
